# GameHacking4Fun

This repository is a personal collection of game hacking projects, each targeting a different game and exploring unique techniques. From memory patching and manual mapping to shellcode injection and API hooking, every folder contains a self-contained experiment built to understand and manipulate real-time game behavior.

The focus varies per project — some use pure shellcode, others involve remote threads, breakpoint tricks, or IAT analysis — but the goal is always the same: **deepen knowledge of Windows internals, debugging, and low-level systems programming** through practical, hands-on exploration.
